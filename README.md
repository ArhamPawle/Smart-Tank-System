# Smart-Tank-System

This project aim is to create a smart tank which would fill/empty the tank on the basis of level of water with the help of a servo motor. When the water level reaches at a point about to fill, the servo motor rotates and closes the inlet of water . If the level of water is below a level, it will rotate the servo motor to allow the level of water. The level of water is displayed on the LCD screen.
